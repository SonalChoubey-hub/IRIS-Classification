Oasis Infobyte Internship Project
Author: Sonal Choubey
# Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project centers on leveraging machine learning to classify iris flowers into three distinct species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. These species can be identified based on four key physical features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
By analyzing these attributes, the model aims to automate species identification—offering impactful applications in botany, horticulture, and ecological research.

🎯 Objective
To design and implement a machine learning model capable of classifying iris species accurately based on their morphological features. The goal is to streamline the identification process using data-driven insights.

🧠 Project Highlights
Dataset: Classic Iris dataset with labeled measurements across the three species.

Techniques: Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model tuning, and performance evaluation.

Models Explored: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (tuned & untuned).

Metric Focus: Recall was prioritized to ensure sensitivity in species prediction.

📊 Results Summary
Sl. No.	Model Variant	Recall (Train)	Recall (Test)
